I decided a few days ago that the world needs another blog. So here I am
to give my random thoughts and opinions on programming and software
architecture. 

Anyway, my name is Mark Glenn and I am a senior software
engineer at a non-profit organization. I currently work in the realm of
.NET and starting to move into the Ruby on Rails market. Prior to this
work, I was doing C/C++ work for the financial industry using high speed
algorithms for automated trading. I also worked R&D at a cell phone
company where I handled creating the software that would run on our
prototypes. I've also created multiple open source projects, which I
will link to in the future.

As you can tell, I have a very broad background in the software industry. I've done embedded, web, and high
speed client/server applications. I'm hoping that this kind of knowledge
base will help me differentiate my blog posts from the vast realm of
other programming blogs. Probably won't happen, but hopefully I can
entertain and inform some people in the art of software design and
programming. 

Most of the topics here will be based around .NET, Ruby on
Rails, and C/C++. I also hope to go into deeper subjects such as
architecture, functional and object oriented programming, and code
quality. Occasionally, I'll talk about some of the projects that I'll be
working on and give some details in how I will implement things. 

If you
like, please [follow me on twitter](http://www.twitter.com/codefixes/). I'll let people know when I post here
and you'll get some random tidbits about what I'm doing or currently
working on. You can also leave comments on here to let me know if
something I wrote confuses you or to let me know I'm flat out wrong. I'm
hoping to invoke some good discussions and I'm happy to take some
criticism. 

Also, as you can see, this site is a little plain. I'll work
on that in the future, but right now I want to work on the content.
